🧹 Bike Sales Data Cleaning Project
📘 Overview

The Bike Sales Data Cleaning Project focuses on transforming raw, inconsistent sales data into a structured and analysis-ready format. This project demonstrates essential data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation techniques using the dataset bike_sales_dataset.xlsx.
The main goal is to ensure that all customer, product, and order information is accurate, consistent, and reliable for business intelligence and visualization.

🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Identify and handle missing values – Detect incomplete records and apply suitable imputation methods.

Remove duplicates – Eliminate redundant rows or repeated Customer_IDs, Product_IDs, and Emails.

Correct data types and formats – Ensure numeric, date, and categorical columns use appropriate data types.

Detect and handle outliers – Identify unusual price, quantity, or feedback values that distort analysis.

Standardize text and categories – Normalize naming conventions (e.g., category names, product names).

Validate data integrity – Cross-check key relationships (Customer ↔ Orders ↔ Products).

Generate a clean dataset – Produce a final dataset ready for analytics, machine learning, or visualization.

🧠 Key Steps

Data Import & Inspection – Load the Excel file, explore sheets, and understand column structures.

Missing Value Treatment – Fill missing names, emails, and feedback using defined strategies.

Data Type Conversion – Convert columns like Price, Quantity, and Order_Date to correct types.

String & Category Normalization – Fix inconsistent capitalization and spacing across categories.

Outlier Detection & Correction – Identify outliers in Price, Quantity, and Feedback_Score using statistical methods.

Data Deduplication – Remove duplicate entries in rows, Customer_IDs, and Product_IDs.

Final Export – Save the cleaned dataset as cleaned_bike_sales_dataset.xlsx and a CSV version.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

OpenPyXL for Excel handling

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for development

Excel / CSV for data export and verification

📂 Dataset

File Name: bike_sales_dataset.xlsx
Description: Contains multiple sheets with customer, product, and order details for a fictional bike store. The dataset includes issues like missing values, inconsistent capitalization, duplicate IDs, and potential outliers.

🚀 Expected Outcomes

A fully cleaned, verified version of the dataset.

A documented workflow showing each cleaning step.

Summary statistics and integrity validation for key business metrics.

A dataset suitable for dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) and predictive models.

💡 Future Enhancements

Automate the data cleaning process using Python pipelines.

Build validation scripts for live data entry.

Integrate with BI dashboards for real-time updates.

Add automated data quality reports and logs.

Would you like me to add a section for sample Python code or cleaning workflow steps (like how missing values or duplicates are handled in your dataset)?
